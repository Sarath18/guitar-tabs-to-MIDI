### Working
- Reads the file from the location specified by the user
- Preprocesses the file
    - Removes unwanted characters
    - Maps the notes in the tabs to MIDI pitch information
- Converts the preprocessed output into `.mid` file
    - Sets the tempo and instrument for the track
    - Places the notes into the MIDI file
- Plays the `.mid` file

##### Mapping
The initial note of each string (open string notes) are mapped to the MIDI pitch as shown in fig. The subsequent notes on the fretboard is the shift from the intial note on that string. `note pitch = inital pitch of string + fret number`
